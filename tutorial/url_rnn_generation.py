# Creating the Network
# ====================
#
# This network extends `the last tutorial's RNN <#Creating-the-Network>`__
# with an extra argument for the category tensor, which is concatenated
# along with the others. The category tensor is a one-hot vector just like
# the letter input.
#
# We will interpret the output as the probability of the next letter. When
# sampling, the most likely output letter is used as the next input
# letter.
#
# I added a second linear layer ``o2o`` (after combining hidden and
# output) to give it more muscle to work with. There's also a dropout
# layer, which `randomly zeros parts of its
# input <https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580>`__ with a given probability
# (here 0.1) and is usually used to fuzz inputs to prevent overfitting.
# Here we're using it towards the end of the network to purposely add some
# chaos and increase sampling variety.

# Training
# =========
# Preparing for Training
# ----------------------
#
# First of all, helper functions to get random pairs of (category, line):
#

import random

# Random item from a list
def randomChoice(l):
    return l[random.randint(0, len(l) - 1)]

######################################################################
# For each timestep (that is, for each letter in a training word) the
# inputs of the network will be
# ``(category, current letter, hidden state)`` and the outputs will be
# ``(next letter, next hidden state)``. So for each training set, we'll
# need the category, a set of input letters, and a set of output/target
# letters.
#
# Since we are predicting the next letter from the current letter for each
# timestep, the letter pairs are groups of consecutive letters from the
# line - e.g. for ``"ABCD<EOS>"`` we would create ("A", "B"), ("B", "C"),
# ("C", "D"), ("D", "EOS").
#

# tensor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot>`__ of size
# ``<1 x n_categories>``. When training we feed it to the network at every
# timestep - this is a design choice, it could have been included as part
# of initial hidden state or some other strategy.

# Sampling the Network
# ====================
#
# To sample we give the network a letter and ask what the next one is,
# feed that in as the next letter, and repeat until the EOS token.
#
# -  Create tensors for input category, starting letter, and empty hidden
#    state
# -  Create a string ``output_name`` with the starting letter
# -  Up to a maximum output length,
#
#    -  Feed the current letter to the network
#    -  Get the next letter from highest output, and next hidden state
#    -  If the letter is EOS, stop here
#    -  If a regular letter, add to ``output_name`` and continue
#
# -  Return the final name
#
# .. Note::
#    Rather than having to give it a starting letter, another
#    strategy would have been to include a "start of string" token in
#    training and have the network choose its own starting letter.
#

# Exercises
# =========
#
# -  Try with a different dataset of category -> line, for example:
#
#    -  Fictional series -> Character name
#    -  Part of speech -> Word
#    -  Country -> City
#
# -  Use a "start of sentence" token so that sampling can be done without
#    choosing a start letter
# -  Get better results with a bigger and/or better shaped network
#
#    -  Try the nn.LSTM and nn.GRU layers
#    -  Combine multiple of these RNNs as a higher level network
#
